Horse Riding School appointment service, based on websockets served by django-channels (dockerized)

This will be my new personal project, which, if it works out fine, I plan to gift to my family (they run a horse riding school and prefer to stick to 'old-school' scheduling books, having to copy those manually). Django channels should provide transparency, so that every client coming to visit the app, will see up-to-date state of affairs and should be able to book his/her appointment using one of available slots.


### NOTE (20.08.2022):
Please bear in mind this project will serve me as a bit of a playground, since I do not have previous experience with Docker and intend to experiment a little with django-channels, hence I anticipate the development pace to be rather slow (for the next few days I will probably do a little digging and try out some tutorials on Docker before I start 'for good'). :)
